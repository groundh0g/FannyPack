[FannyPack](http://fpack.moreoncode.com/) is again under active development. 

I'm still working on writing a new [book on MonoGame](https://leanpub.com/monogamecodecamps), but FannyPack is now an integral part of that process. SpriteSheets is (mostly) feature complete. I'm currently designing the Tile Editor tool. 

I'm also converting the site to Bootstrap 3, so please [let me know](https://github.com/groundh0g/FannyPack/issues) if you see any issues.
