{% include JB/setup %}

[Sprite Sheets](http://fpack.moreoncode.com/sheets.html) is squarely in Alpha (v0.1.0). 
It's fully functional, with [no known bugs](https://github.com/groundh0g/FannyPack/issues?state=open). 
Only the MaxRects packer and sprite rotation function are missing from my version one 
wish list.

I started work on the second of the three tools this morning - Sprite Fonts. The current 
plan is to launch the font tool with the following features:

* Support for all Google Fonts, with others to follow
* Multiple fonts in the same texture
* User-specified glyph ranges and lists
* Data to include height, ascent, kerning information
* Image replacement for specified characters
* Support for user-supplied WOFF, OTF, and TTF
* Support for multiple styles, sizes, and weights
* Possible support for user-supplied EOT and SVG?

I can't promise that all those will make the first draft, but that's my goal.
