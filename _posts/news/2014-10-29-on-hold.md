[FannyPack](http://fpack.moreoncode.com/) is on hold for a while. I've shifted my attention to writing a new [book on MonoGame](https://leanpub.com/monogamecodecamps).

Microsoft's XNA has been mothballed, so I'm contributing to, and writing about, it's opensource replacement - [MonoGame](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame).

I reset the delivery dates for the [first two phases](https://github.com/groundh0g/FannyPack/issues) of FannyPack - SpriteSheets and SpriteFonts. I think early next year is an ambitious, but achievable, goal.
