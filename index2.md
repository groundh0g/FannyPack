## What is Fanny Pack?

Fanny Pack is a suite of tools that I developed for my game programming students. There are certainly 
better products out there, but I wanted my students to have access to free tools and, more importantly, 
access to the source code for those tools. I also didn't want the tools to look like poop that was 
designed in the 80's.

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">
	<tr>
		<td style="width:33%; text-align:center; white-space:nowrap;">
![TileEditor]({{BASE_PATH}}assets/img/index/iconTileEditor.png "Tile Editor is Coming Soon.")
A tool that manages the placement of a fixed <br/>
set of tiled images. By painting these tiles <br/>
into place, entire game worlds can be made. <br/>

## What Makes Fanny Pack So Special?

It's certainly not its features. The commercial offerings provide options and functionality that 
aren't (yet) supported in this suite of tools. The biggest benefits of Fanny Pack are that it's 
open source, and that it doesn't require you to install anything. Everything runs in your browser.

## Say What?

You read that right. Everything runs in your browser. The technology that drives Fanny Pack is 
vanilla HTML5 and JavaScript. That means that you can use the app from any operating system, 
using any modern web browser. 

You don't have to be an administrator on your computer. You don't have to worry about updates. 

At least, that's the idea. I've been developing on my MacBook Pro, using Google's Chrome web 
browser. I'll be doing more extensive testing in the near future.

## What's Up with the Name?

Fanny Pack was initially intended to simply be a sprite sheet packer. Texture Packer (by @CodeAndWeb) 
was the inspiration, so I chose a name that included "pack", but was less likely to get me sued. 

Since its inception, though, the project has grown to become a suite of tools. I decided to keep the 
name. It's a geeky representation of a utility belt. (Think Schneider or Batman.) Besides, I like it.
